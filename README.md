# Sobel_Filter
Sobel Filter Verilog  implementation


This project involves the implementation of the Sobel algorithm using Verilog in Vivado. 


You can change the image you want to load by modifying the `define read_fileName "C:\\Users\\M4-249\\Desktop\\sobel_FPGA-main\\street.bmp"` expression in the testbench. 
This "C" extension expression indicates the path of the image. 


An image with a resolution of 640x480 has been used. 
You can find the image size information in the module named "sobel_data_modulate.v". 


!!!!!!
Simulation is sufficient for the algorithm to work; synthesis is not required.
